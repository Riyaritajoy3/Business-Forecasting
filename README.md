# Business-Forecasting

In this project, we will try to forecast co-relation between footfall and temperature in a national park
The Forecast will help national park employees to arrange resources/employees/volunteers according to expected footfalls. This is doen to ensure safety of the visitors as well as conservation of the wildlife flora and fauna
The Data Set has dates ranging from 2011 - 2013, however a few months in the beginning of 2011 are missing along with temperature as well as footfalls
The data was obtained from google datasets. 
There are a few other resources where the  data is available, however the are in the form of Bar charts over the year which was not sufficient to make a forecast
